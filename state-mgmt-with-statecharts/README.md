### Session Title

State management and deep-linking with statecharts

### Session Abstract

The state of an AngularJS app is spread across multiple scopes and services making it difficult
to reason about and causing hard to detect bugs. David Harel Statecharts make state explicit and
easier to manage. In this talk we will explore statecharts as a means of managing app states with
the added benefit of providing deep-linking as an alternative to ngRoute and ui-router.
